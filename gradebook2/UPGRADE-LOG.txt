Documenting the upgrade process between gradebook2 versions:

==================
* 1.5.x To 1.6.0 *
==================

LOG:
- GRBK-616 : Adding DO_SHOW_STATISTICS_CHART field to edu-service/gradebook-service

SQL:
- upgrade/sakai/GRBK-616-oracle.sql

PATCH:
- upgrade/sakai/GRBK-616-edu-service.patch
- upgrade/gradebook2/GRBK-616.patch

NOTES:
In order to run GWT DEV mode with GRBK-616 in place, you need to patch and build the 
version of edu-service that you are referencing in .classpath.
e.g.
svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/edu-services/branches/edu-services-1.1.x
cd edu-services-1.1.x
patch -p0 < upgrade/sakai/GRBK-616-edu-service.patch
mvn clean install

Then make sure that you reference the newly built edu-service JAR, which is located
in your local maven repository, in your .classpath file.

Since the GRBK-616 changes have not been applied to the Sakai Foundation
edu-service yet, see SAK-20844, we "disabled" the gradebook2 dependent code so that 
it builds (Sakai Hudson). This will change once the gradebook2 dependent version of
edu-service gets updated with the above changes.

So the last step is to patch the gradebook2 source with upgrade/gradebook2/GRBK-616.patch
