STEPS FOR UPGRADING GRADEBOOK2 FROM 1.1.x TO 1.2.x


With the release of Gradebook2 version 1.2.0 there are several important 
configuration changes that need to be taken into account. We added a number 
of new database columns to the old "gradebook" data model, and this necessitates 
a further patch to that code, as well as a database change. If you're running 
a Sakai instance with auto.ddl turned on then you can ignore step 4 with the 
database scripts.  

Finally, we've made several changes to the way the code is deployed in maven, 
and if you're running a Sakai 2.5 environment you'll need to pass a profile
in to the mvn command so it knows which version of Sakai you're building against.


(1) Apply data model code patch:
> cd gradebook
> patch -p0 < ../gradebook2/sakai/2-5-x/gradebook-upgrade-1.1.x-to-1.2.x.patch

(2) Apply the parent pom version patch:
> cd gradebook2
> patch -p0 < sakai/2-5-x/gradebook2.patch 

(3) From now on you'll need to include  -Psakai2.5 as an arg to the mvn command
> mvn clean install sakai:deploy -Psakai2.5

(4) If you're starting from a 1.1.x database and don't have auto.ddl turned on,
run one of the following database scripts (doesn't include commit statement):
sakai/2-5-x/sql/oracle/conversion_1.1.x_to_1.2.x.sql
sakai/2-5-x/sql/mysql/conversion_1.1.x_to_1.2.x.sql
