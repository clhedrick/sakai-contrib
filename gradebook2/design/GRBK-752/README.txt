This directory will contain design source files for GRBK-752, the import redesign/refactor.  Currently there are only mockups.  These mockups were developed using Evolus Pencil which is a UI mockup plugin for FF 3.X.  

Unfortunately the version that is in the add on gallery doesn't work quite right.  To get the proper XPI file for FF,  go to:
 
http://pencil.evolus.vn/en-US/Home.aspx 

and download version 1.2.  These mockups also need the GXT stencils which are available on that site as well.
